    <p>
      Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal
      named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of ninja monkeys. Among the monkeys
      there was one standout with a legendary name. His name was king Julien.
      King Julien worked hard to achieve this title, once reserved only for
      those of royal birth. His main job was to lead all of the other monkey's ,
      since he was the only one who learned to speak to humans. It was a
      difficult task, Kai-Yun was an inententive leader, and the monkeys only
      dealt with absolutes like "true" or "false." But One day they were
      challenged by a swarm of seemingly unstoppable bugs.
